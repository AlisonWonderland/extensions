# This American Life MP3 Download Extension

I created this extension so that I can download old This American Life podcast episodes with ease from their website. I find their website easier to use to find and know which episodes to listen than Itunes.

* As you can see here, there is a download link on newer episodes:

* But on older episodes there isn't a direct link. Even though the mp3 file is linked in the html page just like newer episodes. The download portion leads to amazon and itunes links.

* The extension takes the mp3 link and makes a red download link to it appear when the user presses the play button.
