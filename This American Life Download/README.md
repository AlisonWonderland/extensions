# This American Life MP3 Download Extension

I created this extension so that can older download podcast episodes with ease.

## Extension in action
As you can see here, there is a download link on newer episodes:

But on older episodes there isn't a direct link. Even though the mp3 file is linked in the html page just like newer episodes. The download portion leads to amazon and itunes links.

The extension takes the mp3 link and makes a red download link to it appear when the user presses the play button.
